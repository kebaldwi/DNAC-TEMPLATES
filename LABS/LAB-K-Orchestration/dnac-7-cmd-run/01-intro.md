# Running Show Commands

In this module, we will use *Postman* to run some show commands on network devices within the infrastructure that Cisco DNA Center manages. This allows a method of getting troubleshooting information in the event we need to populate 3rd party management systems.

## Command Runner Background

The Command Runner tool allows you to run cli commands from the Inventory window on platforms. 

The platform commands that you can run are those such as ping, traceroute, and snmpget to troubleshoot device reachability issues. Additionally, show commands may also help or aid in troubleshooting.

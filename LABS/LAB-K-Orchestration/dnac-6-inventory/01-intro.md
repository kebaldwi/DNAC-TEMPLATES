# Retrieve Device Inventory

In this module, we will use *Postman* to retrieve the device inventory of the hierarchy within Cisco DNA Center. 

Cisco DNA Center uses hierarchy to align infrastructure needs logically against intent. This allows the network administrator to align change requests and outage windows to allow for changes and modifications to the network.

##  Cisco DNA Center Inventory Background

DNA Center keeps a detailed inventory of the devices discovered or onboarded from the network. The inventory is used to reference devices in the Cisco DNA Center UI but also offers a place to see detailed information about the Product ID, Hostname, Software Image, and much more.

The inventory could be used in reports to determine compliance or to reference the devices within the system for either deploying templates or issuing show commands with the command runner used earlier.

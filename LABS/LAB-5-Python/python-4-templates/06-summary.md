## Summary

We have been able to build and deploy templates from within a project in Catalyst Centers. 

This scenario may be augmented and modified to use build out a development and production pipeline to allow for a more dynamic approach. The flow allows us to rapidly stage Projects and Templates, perhaps importing them from GitHub in the CICD pipeline to Development and then after successful testing push automatically to production.

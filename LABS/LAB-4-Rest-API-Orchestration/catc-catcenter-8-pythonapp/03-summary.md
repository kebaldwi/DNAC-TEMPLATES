# Summary

We have been able to run a Python Application, which allowed us to utilize many REST API calls within a workflow. It also showed how well they can be put together in a chain to achieve a desired goal. 

ServiceNow integrations can be made with a prebuilt Cisco DNA Center APP, within the APP store, but they can also be formed utilizing the Python APP. Its possible to augment your ServiceNow integration with your own code extending and enhancing the capabilities brought forth by an ITSM.

# Archiving Device Configurations

We will now use the REST-API's within the collection `Configuration Archive` to pull the configuration archives for all devices within the inventory. 

This collection will first get a list of devices, then download the configuration archive for each one. You will need to save the responses to download them.

There is a difference in the way we will approach this use case because of the way the API was written. The API was developed to download or archive a specific configuration. To Archive multiple configurations you would create a loop. As Postman has nowhere to send the data as a zip file we will do only one of these. Normally you would loop through and archive them into a file store.

Follow these steps:

## Open the Collection Runner

Navigate and open the desired collection runner through the following:

   1. Within Postman, click on the collection shortcut in the sidebar
   2. Hover over the collection `Catalyst Center API LAB 304 - Configuration Archive`
   3. Click the `Run Collection` submenu option

      ![Open Collection Runner](./assets/Postman-Collection-ConfigArchive.png?raw=true)

## Run the Collection

To run the collection, do the following:

   1. Locate the sub-components of the `Runner`
   2. Optionally select the `Save Responses` option
   3. Click  the `Run Catalyst Center API LAB 304 - Configuration Archive` button

      ![Run Collection](./assets/Postman-Collection-ConfigArchive-Runner.png?raw=true)

## Retrieve the Archive

1. The following summary will slowly appear as the collection is processed

   1. Copy the Password `TestT3$t` to open the zip file later.

   2. Click the console at the bottom of Postman and search for the last API call made.

   3. Expand the results of the API call and open the `Response Body`
   4. Notice the file response does have the Configurations in it. This API Collection collected all of them and, if exported to a Python system, could save them to a local file folder.

2. Click on the collection `Catalyst Center API LAB 304 - Configuration Archive` to expand it in the left pane, then do the following:

   1. Click on the Rest-API `Get Results` sub-component to open it on the right
   2. Click on the little arrow on the right of `Send` to expose a submenu
   3. Click `Send and Download` to send this Rest-API and automatically download what is retrieved

      ![Get Request](./assets/Postman-Collection-ConfigArchive-ResultsAPI.png?raw=true)

3. As the Rest-API `Get Results`completes an explorer window will prompt to save the results to the desktop click ok to save the file

4. Locate the zip file on the desktop, and extract it using whatever extraction tool is available to your system. WinRar is what can be used and is displayed here.

   ![Extract](./assets/Postman-Collection-ConfigArchive-Extract.png?raw=true)

5. During Extraction, you will be prompted for the password we stored from step 6, but again it is `TestT3$t` in the event you can't locate it. Enter the password as prompted and complete the extraction.

6. Locate the Extracted folder and open one of the text-based files within to reveal the configuration selected.

## Summary

Congratulations, in this lablet, we used *Postman* to download an archive of the `running` and `startup` configurations of devices from Cisco Catalyst Center. 

Cisco Catalyst Center allows for the `archiving` of both the `running` and `startup` Configurations for devices within the inventory of Cisco Catalyst Center. 

In the earlier Cisco Catalyst Center GUI's, there was no capability to archive the configurations apart from this REST-API-based approach. Additional capabilities have been added to the most recent version of Cisco Catalyst Center, but there remain good use cases for this capability.

> **Note**: Additionally, if there is time, look at the pre and post-scripts within Postman.

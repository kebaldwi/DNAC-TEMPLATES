# Using Command Runner

We will now initiate a `show cdp neighbor` command against `c9300-2` managed by Cisco Catalyst Center using the Rest-API within the collection `Catalyst Center API LAB 402 - Command Runner`

Follow these steps:

## Open the collection runner

Navigate and open the desired collection runner through the following:

   1. Within Postman, click on the collection shortcut in the sidebar
   2. Hover over the collection `Catalyst Center API LAB 402 - Command Runner`
   3. Click the `Run Collection` submenu option

      ![Open Collection Runner](./assets/Postman-Collection-CmdRun.png?raw=true)

## Run the collection

To run the collection, do the following:

   1. Ensure all the sub-components of the `Runner` are selected
   2. Select the `Save Responses` option as we will need the output
   3. Click `Select file`, then select the `CSV` by clicking `Open`
   4. Click  the `Run Catalyst Center API LAB 402 - Command Runner` button

## Summary

We have been able to run diagnostic commands via Rest-API, which is useful if we want to get any `show` command or output from any diagnostic command to a third-party system. This allows us to augment Cisco Catalyst Center and create whatever we like regarding troubleshooting support for other platforms like ServiceNow or other 3rd party Rest-API-based ITSM tools. 

> **Note**: Additionally, if there is time, look at the pre and post-scripts within Postman.

At this point, we have built the Hierarchy, Settings and Credentials, utilizing variables and REST-API's within the Python programs via **CI/CD**. Now the great part is that if you left the job running it would always monitor that file and update what it needed to when it occurred.

To continue your learning, look at the various REST-API's used to complete this task.

Within the lab environment we will use the SSH application `mRemoteNG` located on the desktop on the `Jump Host` to connect to the `Script Server`. The script server is an Ubuntu 20.04.3 Server with all the software loaded to complete this section.

Complete the following:

1. Open the `mRemoteNG application from the desktop using the icons shown.

   ![json](./images/ansible-connect.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

2. Within the mRemoteNG application double click on the Script Server and an SSH connection will open to the Ubuntu Server.

## SSL Settings and disabling Validation

For lab purposes, DNA Center utilizes a self-signed certificate which would fail any validation precheck. To test in the lab, we will therefore disable this setting.

Follow these steps:

1. Click the settings gear icon on the top right of postman.

   ![json](./images/Postman-Settings-Menu.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

2. In the Settings window, deselect the **SSL certificate verification**.
